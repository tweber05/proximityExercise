It looks as good as anything we might do with a template, and we've made it from scratch. Just a little CSS and some time, and it is all ready to go. Be extra careful to make sure you've established strong vertical lines on the page! This will make everything hold together much more neatly and create a strong sense of visual unity! It will probably take some fiddling and tweaking to get the lines exactly right. Don't forget that you can use the inspector tool to visualize lines and make sure elements are lining up the way you want them to!</p>
	<p>This column looks a lot better with multiple paragraphs, so I've added a bunch of filler text from the Wizard of Oz.</p>
	<p>"Did you groan?" asked Dorothy.</p>

	<p>"Yes," answered the tin man, "I did.  I've been groaning for more than a year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me."</p>

	<p>"What can I do for you?" she inquired softly, for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke.</p>

	<p>"Get an oil-can and oil my joints," he answered.  "They are rusted so badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon be all right again.  You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage."</p>

	<p>Dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then she returned and asked anxiously, "Where are your joints?"</p>

	<p>"Oil my neck, first," replied the Tin Woodman.  So she oiled it, and as it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the man could turn it himself.</p>

	<p>"Now oil the joints in my arms," he said.  And Dorothy oiled them and the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust and as good as new.</p>

	<h4>Right Sidebar</h4>
	Often times, right sidebars are used to provide about information, or other material that glosses what is going on on the page. Maybe this is a mission statement, or a reminder that the reader is looking at your portfolio. Maybe it provides a personal narrative, or provides recent site content. An RSS reader widget could also go here, allowing you to pull in snippets of content from around the web and aggregate them for your readers.
